# Prioritise

Prioritise is a simple python script to control the priority of processes on a Windoes system.

## Usage

1. Download the program (Code dropdown -> Download as zip)
2. Run the setup.bat file
3. Run the Ccreate_task.bat file as administrator (This allows the script to change the priority of administrator processes such as aidiodg.exe)
4. Configure config.json

The script will start the next time you restart your computer, or you could manually run start.bat as administator.

Two example processes are included in the config.bat file.

#### List of priorities:

```
low
below_normal
normal
above_normal
high
realtime
```
